# uzi — Frontend Developer & UI Designer

I craft modern, performance-driven websites with a strong focus on clean layouts, transparent UI effects, and seamless interactions. My aim is simple: interfaces that *feel* as good as they look — intuitive, fast, and visually refined.

I specialize in frontend development with solid design principles, combining aesthetic precision with clean, maintainable code. No fluff — just thoughtful UI, responsive design, and continuous iteration.
