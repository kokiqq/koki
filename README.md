# Hey there! I'm uzi 👋

I'm a web developer with a passion for sleek, modern design — think transparent effects, clean layouts, and interactive interfaces. I love building visually striking websites that don’t just *work*, but *wow*.  

💻 I started coding a few years ago and never stopped. Whether it's frontend wizardry or experimenting with new UI/UX ideas, I’m always creating something cool.

🕹️ When I’m not knee-deep in code, I’m probably vibing with some music, gaming, or dreaming up new design systems.
